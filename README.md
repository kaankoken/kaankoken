## About Me

Hi, I'm Kaan Köken, a Computer Engineer with 3.5+ years of experience in Software Engineering. Most of my friends call me Legolas. I have a strong background in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Go, Rust, and Dart.

I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, which is where I got my nickname. In my free time, I enjoy listening to EDM, piano, and purely instrumental music.
I enjoy cooking a meal & try new recipes.

Currently, I'm working at GAİN, a leading OTT platform in Turkey, as a Mobile Application Developer (Flutter) for almost two years. Prior to that, I worked as an Android Developer for one and a half years on various projects.

I'm a firm believer in open-source and try to contribute to projects as much as I can. So far, I have contributed to three open-source projects:

- [Envied](https://github.com/petercinibulk/envied)
- [Trading Timeseries](https://github.com/evsamsonov/trading-timeseries)
- [Trading Indicators](https://github.com/evsamsonov/trading-indicators)

I have a great passion for Rust and Data Engineering. Although I enjoy being a Mobile Application Developer and working with Flutter, I aim to work with Rust in Data Engineering. I'm currently developing my own projects using Rust and Flutter.
